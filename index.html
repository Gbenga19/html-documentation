                HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML. The term represents two different concepts. It is a new version of the language HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors, and a larger set of technologies that allows the building of more diverse and powerful Web sites and applications. This set is sometimes called HTML5 & friends and often shortened to just HTML5.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML5 is the fifth revision and newest version of the HTML standard. It offers new features that provide not only rich media support but also enhance support for creating web applications that can interact with users, their local data, and servers more easily and effectively than was previously possible.

            <ul>
                <li>Some HTML5 features remain unsupported by some browsers. However, Gecko, and by extension, Firefox, has very good support for HTML5, and work continues toward supporting more of its features. Gecko began supporting some HTML5 features in version 1.8.1.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can find a list of all of the HTML5 features that Gecko currently supports on the main HTML5 page. For detailed information about multiple browsers' support of HTML5 features, refer to the CanIUse website.

                Place this right after your <head>, as some browsers restart the parsing of an HTML document if the declared character set is different from what they had anticipated.
                    <code>UTF-8</code>
                </p>
            <p>
                Also, if you are not currently using UTF-8, it's recommended that you switch to it in your web pages, as it simplifies character handling in documents using different scripts.
                <code>Meta data=""</code>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Note that HTML5 restricts character sets to those compatible with ASCII and using at least 8 bits. This was done to tighten security and prevent some types of attacks.
